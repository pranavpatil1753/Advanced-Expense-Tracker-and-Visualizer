# Advanced-Expense-Tracker-and-Visualizer

The Expense Tracker and Visualizer with Forecasting is a comprehensive tool designed to help users manage their finances effectively by tracking, categorizing, and visualizing their expenses. The tool allows users to input their expenses manually or through file uploads (CSV/Excel), with each expense categorized into pre-defined or custom categories like food, utilities, entertainment, and transport. Using data analysis techniques, the system visualizes spending trends over different time periods, providing users with time-series graphs, pie charts, and bar charts to display their financial habits. A budget management feature is incorporated, where users can set budgets for each category, and the system will track whether the user is under or over budget. Additionally, the system incorporates advanced forecasting features using the ARIMA model, which analyzes past spending data to predict future expenses over the next 10 to 30 days. Users are notified when they exceed their budget limits, and they can set financial goals for saving money. The application also generates detailed reports that can be exported in various formats, such as CSV, Excel, or PDF. By integrating machine learning models for forecasting and anomaly detection, this project demonstrates expertise in data analysis, time-series forecasting, and building financial tools with real-world applications.
